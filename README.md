 While I am following this awesome tutorial, I am typing this code out.
 
 I think the instructor is using a different verion of rails from the one I am using.
 
 So I list my development environment here.
 
 My OS:
 
 Mac OS X 10.8.3 (primary)
 
 Windows 8 (when my mac is not around)
 
 My ruby (on mac):
 
 ruby --version
 
 ruby 1.8.7 (2012-02-08 patchlevel 358) [universal-darwin12.0]
 
 My gem (on mac):
 
 gem --version
 
 2.0.3
 
 My rails (on mac):
 
 rails --version
 
 Rails 3.2.13
